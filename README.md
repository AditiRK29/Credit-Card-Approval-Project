# **Section** 1: The importance of this project lies in the fact that predicting good clients is crucial for banks to minimize risks and maximize profits. Accurate credit card approval prediction can help banks identify high-risk applicants and make informed decisions. This project can have a significant impact on the banking sector by reducing the number of bad loans and improving the overall creditworthiness of customers.
There is a gap in the knowledge of using machine learning models to predict credit card approval in the Indian banking sector. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a predictive model that can be used by banks in India to improve their credit card approval process.
# Section 2: Based on the questions above, the initial hypothesis is that:
1. Annual income, and employment status are strong predictors of credit card approval.
2. Machine learning models can be used to identify patterns in customer data that are indicative of creditworthiness.
3. The proposed model will be able to predict credit card approval with an accuracy of at least 80%.
# Section 3: Data Analysis Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The Credit_Card.csv and Credit_card_label.csv datasets will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and handle outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques will be used to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
3. Feature engineering: Relevant feature engineering techniques will be applied to extract meaningful features from the data.
4. Data visualization: Data visualization techniques will be used to visualize the results of the EDA and feature engineering steps.

# Section 4: Machine Learning Approach

1. Model selection: Multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, will be selected and trained on the dataset.
2. Model evaluation: The performance of each model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Model comparison: The performance of each model will be compared, and the best-performing model will be selected.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to improve the accuracy of the selected model.

The most appropriate model will be justified based on the performance metrics and cost functions.
